# kmean_hierarchial-clustering
Unsupervised algorithm
KMeans clustering is an iterative algorithm that partitions a dataset into K distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters). For each cluster, it calculates the centroid (the average of all points in the cluster) and assigns each data point to the cluster whose centroid is nearest. The algorithm iterates until the assignments no longer change or a maximum number of iterations is reached
